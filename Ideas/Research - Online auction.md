### Users
- Primary users will be customer who like to buy cheaper products, they could be any : students, older people, people in other countries etc.<br>
- Primary users will also be retailers who are trying to sell their dead stock or advertising their products or other consumers who buy stuff from retailer in bulk and sell it to the customer, this could be indirect connection of the retailer and the customer.
- Primary users will also be users who want to sell stuff online, they can either sell directly at a fix price or put it out for auction. Lets say someone wants to sell their jordan sneakers and if we assume that the reselling value of that sneaker is higher than the buying price, so they can post their listing over here.
- Secondary users will be support members who will assist primary users in querys such as account creation connecting the retailers with the customer, placing match and minimum bets and technical support required throughout the browsing of the website.
- Tertiary users will be the company(retailers) directors who would like to provide their products and also it will be the site owners and team whenever there is server breakdown.(Noting the fact that we arent doing any server side programming).
